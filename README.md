# Functional Design and Architecture in Scala

This repository contains my interpretations and implementations of concepts from the book Functional Design and Architecture by Alexander Granin. The book provides a thorough exploration of functional design principles, with examples implemented in Haskell. Here, I reimplement and adapt these examples in Scala to deepen my understanding and offer a Scala-based reference for readers who may prefer or are more familiar with Scala.

## Why Scala?

While Haskell is a purely functional language and ideal for demonstrating functional design patterns, Scala’s hybrid approach makes it accessible to a broader audience, particularly those working in object-oriented or mixed environments. By implementing the concepts in Scala, I hope to make functional architecture concepts more approachable for Scala developers and provide practical examples that they can use in real-world applications.

## Goals

The main objectives of this repository are:
- To translate Haskell examples from Functional Design and Architecture into Scala, demonstrating how functional design principles can be applied in a different functional programming language.
- To provide a practical guide for Scala developers interested in functional design and architecture concepts.
- To encourage Scala developers to explore functional programming concepts traditionally taught in Haskell, using syntax and constructs available in the Scala ecosystem.
